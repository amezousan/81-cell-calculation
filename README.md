# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

# How to use
This script will show a 81-cell-caluclation sheet as below:
~~~
x/+ | 3 1 4 8 9 7 5 2 6
  2 |
  7 |
  1 |
  8 |
  4 |
  9 |
  6 |
  3 |
  5 |
~~~

You can write down all the numbers on a paper and calculate both "plus(+)" and "cross(x)". It's better to record your calculation time.

## Criterion
### Cross
Time | Comment
---  |---
~60s | This is super awesome! You must be soooooo good :)
~80s | This is pretty good. You can speed up more if you get used to it!
~100s| This is okay because you are a beginner. You can speed up more if you get used to it!
~120s| One more time!

### Plus
(N/A)
